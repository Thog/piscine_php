<- Matrix ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Matrix class represents a 4x4 Matrixs.

It has constants values for different presets:
IDENTITY    = 'IDENTITY',
SCALE       = 'SCALE',
RX          = 'Ox ROTATION',
RY          = 'Oy ROTATION',
RZ          = 'Oz ROTATION',
TRANSLATION = 'TRANSLATION',
PROJECTION  = 'PROJECTION';

They depends on the following arguments respectivly:
IDENTITY    -> nothing
SCALE       -> the scale
RX          -> angle of rotation
RY          -> angle of rotation
RZ          -> angle of rotation
TRANSLATION -> vector (class Vector) of the translation
PROJECTION  -> Field of view (in degrees), Ratio (width/height of screen), near and far z distances

Matrix object values are immutable.

The following method are providing for this Class:

- mult() : return a new matrix corresponding to the multiplication of the instance by the argument

- transformVertex() : return a new Vertex corresponding to the matrix apply to the one sent in argument
