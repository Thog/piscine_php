<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class handles space 3D Vectors.
This class contains three coordinates and a homogenous parameter (always equal to 0)

An instance is contructed from two Vertex orig and dest.
It represents then the vector between thos two points.
new Vector( array( 'dest' => $vertex_dest, 'orig' => $vertex_orig );
If the vertex 'orig' is not precised, it will then be (0,0,0) as default.

All Attributes are private, you can access them using the right getter.
Those attributes are read only.

The following method are providing for this Class:

- magnitude() : give the norme of the instanced Vector.

- normalize() : give the normalized Vector correspondig (a fresh copy
if the instance was already normalized)

- add( Vector $other ) : give the result of the addition between
the current instance and $other.

- sub( Vector $other ) : give the result of the substraction between
the current instance and $other.

- opposite() : return the opposite Vector;

- scalarProduct( $k ) : return the product of the constant $k
and the current instance;

- dotProduct( Vector $other ) : return the scalar product of the current
instance and $other.

- cos( Vector $other ) : return the cosinus between the current instance and $v

Vector crossProduct( Vector $other ) : return the cross product
(right handed set) of the current instance and $v
